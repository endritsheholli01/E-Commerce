			<div id="p1"><p>The ex-England international feels that the Argentine and his colleagues no longer have the same drive and determination that made them world-beaters under Pep Guardiola. Former Manchester United ace Paul Scholes believesthat Barcelona are a "ghost" of the side they were, claiming that Lionel Messi and his team-mates are suffering from "boredom".The Catalans won three consecutive Liga titles, two Copa del Rey crowns, two Champions Leagues and two Fifa Club World Cups during a glorious four-year spell between 2008 and 2012 under former coach Pep Guardiola. Barca failed to claim a single major honour last season, though, and are now finding their feet under new boss Luis Enrique. Scholes went to ...</p>

			<div id="p2"><p>Kevin Durant is in a hole that is mostly not of his own doing but he has been around long enough to know that he will not be forgiven if another season ends without the Oklahoma City Thunder capturing an NBA championship. Durant, the reigning NBA MVP, doesn&#39;t want or expect to get a pass with his eighth season starting at a decided disadvantage after he suffered a broken right foot in the preseason, Russell Westbrook broke his right wrist on opening night, and the Thunder piled up more devastating injuries than wins in the season&#39;s first six weeks.&#8220;I really don&#39;t give a damn what people got to say,&#8221; Durant said. &#8220;I really don&#39;t care if they cut me slack or.... </p>

			<div id="p3"><p>He will coach three more games for this team, but Jim Harbaugh appears to be as good as gone. In truth, he was probably finished with the 49ers before Sunday&#39;s stunning upset at the O.co Coliseum, where his team was outplayed in every phase of the game by a 1-11 squad coming off a 52-0 loss to another outfit with a losing record, the Rams.Yet there was Harbaugh, with 28 seconds to play, still coaching, still grinding, dispensing instructions to the troubled Colin Kaepernick, despite the fact the Niners were trailing 24-13 and 85 yards from Oakland&#39;s end zone. At the end of yet another tough day at the office, one that featured five sacks, two picks against just a single touchdown pass&#59; a 54.4 rating, Kap made a dece...</p></div>
